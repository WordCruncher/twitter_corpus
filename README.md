# twitter_corpus
To use this Python script, make sure you are on a computer that has Python. Many of the BYU lab computers have Python already available.
Instructions to use:
1. Collect your tweets using FireAnt.
2. This creates a .json file. Put the .json file and the twitter2wcr.py file into an empty folder.
3. Open up the Command Prompt program.
4. You will need to navigate to the new folder with the Python script and tweets.json file. To do this, type in without the double quotes "cd C:/Users/vincjess/Tweets/", then press Enter. (Type in your own directory, this is my example.) To make sure you are in the right folder, type in "dir" without double quotes and press Enter. You should see both files in the folder.

For more information on how to use the command prompt, see here: https://www.digitalcitizen.life/command-prompt-how-use-basic-commands

5. Type in one of the following commands. Some computers require you to type in "python3". Others require just "python":
"python3 tweet2wcr.py"
"python tweet2wcr.py"
6. This will convert the file into a WCr-Tweets.etax file. If you have any problems, contact wordcruncher@byu.edu.
7. To get this file into WordCruncher, use the WordCruncher Indexer to convert it into an .etbu file. Then, in WordCruncher, go to File > Open Book > WordCruncher User Library > Options > Add Book > Add the .etbu file.
8. Search, Study, and Analyze your Twitter Corpus!
